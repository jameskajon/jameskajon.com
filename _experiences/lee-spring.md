I started my time at Lee Spring manning the help desk and setting up workstations. I was introduced to SQL and built SSRS reports for the executives. I also worked with global branches to deploy in-house software. As I advanced in the company, I helped coordinate the development of a program to streamline the production process. I collaborated with the Senior Network Administrator to construct a new camera security system. Lastly, I was in charge of designing a human resources portal for managing employee information stored in the database.
