<a href="https://www.leespring.com/" title="Lee Spring Website">Lee Spring</a> is a spring manufacturer located in Brooklyn, NY. During high school, I worked in the IT department for two summers.

I started my time at Lee Spring manning the help desk and setting up workstations. I was introduced to SQL and built SSRS reports for Lee Spring executives. I also worked with global branches to deploy in-house software.

As I advanced in the company, I helped coordinate the development of a program to streamline the production process. I collaborated with the senior network administrator to construct a new camera security system. Lastly, I was in charge of designing a human resources portal for managing employee information stored in the database.
