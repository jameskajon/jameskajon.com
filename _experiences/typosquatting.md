subtitle: Gathered data on npm packages for researching the pervasiveness of typosquatting.
description: Typosquatting is when a package with a similar name to that of a popular package is uploaded to a package manager. I worked with professors L. De Carli and D. Davidson on testing SpellBound, a typosquatting detection tool. I built tools using web scraping and sequence matchers to efficiently analyze 201 pairs of similarly named npm packages to determine if any were malicious.
