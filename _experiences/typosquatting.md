subtitle: Gathered data on NPM packages for researching the pervasiveness of typosquatting.
description: Typosquatting is when a package with a similar name to that of a popular package is uploaded to a package manager. I work with professors L. De Carli and D. Davidson on testing SpellBound, a typosquatting detection tool. My focus was to determine if any of the similarly named packages where dangerous to users. To achieve this goal I manually analyzed 201 pairs of similarly named npm packages using tools I build myself included web scraping and sequence matchers.
