subtitle: Pursuing a BS in Computer Science.
description: <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a> is a STEM college in Worcester, MA. True to itâ€™s translated motto of theory and practice, my course work has an emphasis on executing theory in projects. I find this to be an effective way of learning and was a big role in my interest of attending WPI.
  <br><br>
  At WPI, I have taken many <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/computer-science">Computer Science</a> classes as well others in Math, Engineering, Physics, and German.
  <br><br>
  Part of graduating from WPI includes a project abroad which I will complete in Armenia at the end of the 2019-20 academic year.
