description: WPI is a STEM college in Worcester, MA. True to its motto "Lehr und Kunst" - theory and practice - my coursework had an emphasis on executing theory through projects. I found this to be an effective way of learning and was a big part of my interest in attending WPI. At WPI, I took many Computer Science classes. I rounded out my STEM education with classes in Math, Engineering, and Physics, and also studied German.

<a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a> is a STEM college in Worcester, MA. True to its motto "Lehr und Kunst" - theory and practice - my coursework had an emphasis on executing theory through projects. I found this to be an effective way of learning and was a big part of my interest in attending WPI.

At WPI, I took many <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/computer-science">Computer Science</a> classes. I rounded out my STEM education with classes in Math, Engineering, and Physics, and also studied German.

In March of 2020, my Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) was to involve traveling to Armenia for three months to work with Junior Achievement of Armenia (JAA), our project sponsor. Instead, we worked remotely on a project to heighten JAAâ€™s national recognition. We recommended and started the implementation of social media strategies, and developed a new look for their website, accompanied by a technical handbook.

From October 2020 to May 2021, I worked with <a href="https://new.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a> to complete my Major Qualifying Project (MQP). In a team of four students, we worked on developing their content builder, an online learning tool, which allows teachers to create homework questions for students.
