<a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a> is a STEM college in Worcester, MA. True to its motto "Lehr und Kunst" - theory and practice - my coursework has had an emphasis on executing theory through projects. I find this to be an effective way of learning and was a big part of my interest in attending WPI.

At WPI, I have taken many <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/computer-science">Computer Science</a> classes. I rounded out my STEM education with classes in Math, Engineering, and Physics, and also studied German.

In March of 2020, my Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) was to involve traveling to Armenia for 3 months to work with Junior Achievement of Armenia (JAA), our project sponsor. Instead, we worked remotely on a project to heighten JAA’s national recognition. We recommended and started implementation of social media strategies, and developed a new look for their website, accompanied by a technical handbook.

I will complete my Major Qualifying Project (MQP) in March 2021. I am working on developing the content builder of <a href="https://new.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a>, an online learning tool, which allows teachers to create homework questions for students — a very relevant project for this pandemic time as well as for the future.
