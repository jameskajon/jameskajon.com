subtitle: Pursuing a BS in Computer Science.
description: <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">WPI</a> is a STEM college in Worcester, MA. True to its translated motto of theory and practice, my coursework has had an emphasis on executing theory in projects. I find this to be an effective way of learning and was a big role in my interest in attending WPI.
  <br><br>
  At WPI, I have taken many <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/computer-science">Computer Science</a> classes as well others in Math, Engineering, Physics, and German.
  <br><br>
  Part of graduating from WPI includes a project abroad which I will complete in Armenia at the end of the 2019-20 academic year.
  <br><br>
  My IQP in March - May of 2020 was supposed to involve traveling to Armenia to work with our sponsor. Instead, we worked remotely with them. We work with Junior Achievement of Armenia in order to heighten their recognition. We recommended and started implementation of social media strategies, and developed a new look for their website.
  <br><br>
  I will complete my MQP in March 2021. I am working for ASSISTments on developing the content builder which allows teachers to create homework questions for students.
