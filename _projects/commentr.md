description: In WPI's Design of Software Systems class in the fall of 2020, I worked on a team to build a web application using AWS. Over two months, we implemented many use cases, which are described in the readme. We built the front-end using React and the back-end in Java AWS Lambda functions. My focus in this project was implementing the business logic of the use cases in Lambda functions and managing the DynamoDB database.
