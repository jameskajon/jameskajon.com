subtitle: Worked with eight other students to design a hospital kiosk system for Brigham And Women's Hospital.
description: In WPI's Software Engineering class in the spring of 2019, I worked on a team to design a hospital kiosk application using the agile methodology. This project was divided into four one-week iterations with daily scrums, and included a paper and progress presentation at the end of each iteration.  I was the team's Lead Software Engineer, but also worked in many roles to help our team succeed.
