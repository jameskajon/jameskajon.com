title: Hospital Kiosk
subtitle: Worked with eight other students to design a hospital kiosk system for Brigham And Women's Hospital.
description: In the spring of 2019, I took WPI's Software Engineering course. In this course our class was split into teams which would design a hospital kiosk application using the agile methodology. We worked on our project in four one week iterations with daily scrums. We wrote a paper and presented our progress to the class at the end of each iteration. For this project, I was our teams Lead Software Engineer and worked in many roles to help our team succeed.
