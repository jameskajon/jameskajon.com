subtitle: This website to show off my programming projects and experiences.
description: This website was originally written using the Django framework during the summer of 2019 to highlight my programming projects and experiences. It now serves the same purpose but is written using Jekyll and runs on GitHub Pages instead of Python running on an AWS NGINX server.
