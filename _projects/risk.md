title: Risk
subtitle: Built a web app to play Risk.
description: Risk is a board game from the 1950s about achieving world conquest through intense strategy and planning. It is a game I often played with my parents and brother throughout my childhood.
  <br><br>
  In the last half my senior year of high school, I developed a working version of the game in the command line using Python with neo4j as the database. After this, I converted my command line program into a Django web app.
  <br><br>
  In the summer of 2019, I revisited this project and regretted my database choice. Having initially written the project only half a year after my first real programming experience. I decided the code was not up to my standards for a project I loved so much. I rewrote all game logic in Django models. I also rewrote all JavaScript and most of the HTML and CSS.
