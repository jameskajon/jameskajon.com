Risk is a board game from the 1950s the goal of which is to achieve world conquest through intense strategy and planning. It is a game I often played with my family throughout my childhood.

In the last half of my senior year of high school, I developed a working version of the game in the command line using Python with Neo4j as the database. After this, I converted my command line program into a Django web app.

In the summer of 2019, I revisited this project and regretted my database choice. Having initially written the project only half a year after my first real programming experience, I decided the code was not up to my standards. I rewrote all game logic in Django models. I also rewrote all JavaScript and most of the HTML and CSS.
