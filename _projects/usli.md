title: NASA USLI
subtitle: Competed with other WPI students in USLI 2018-2019.
description: In this competition, I worked with ECE team members to develop a GPS tracking module as well as programmed the modules using C++. The modules integrate an Arduino Nano, NEO-6MV2 GPS, and an Adafruit RFM96W LoRa radio transceiver as well as controls four motors for the unfolding of the payload. These modules transmit GPS coordinates and well as listening for commands send from the base station. The modules were successful in testing but were unable to be tested in launch.
