subtitle: Competed with other WPI students in USLI 2018-2019.
description: In this competition, we planned to launch our rocket to about 4683 ft before breaking into sections and releasing its payload. Once landed, our payload would open up and deliver a beacon it was launched with to a marked destination. Per NASA's requirements, all disjoint parts of the rocket must be tracked by GPS. I worked with ECE team members to develop a GPS module for each of the three sections. Using C++ I programmed the Arduino Nano of the modules which integrated NEO-6MV2 GPS, and an Adafruit RFM96W LoRa radio transceiver, and four motors. These modules transmitted GPS coordinates and listened for commands sent from the base station. The modules were successful in testing, however, during launch, the rocket failed before the modules could be operated.
